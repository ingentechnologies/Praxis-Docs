## API Structure

The Praxis AI API is organized into several functional areas:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Prompts" icon="file-lines" href="/api-reference/prompts/get">
    Endpoints for managing and retrieving prompts, versions, and tags
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor" icon="chart-line" href="/api-reference/monitor/log">
    Endpoints for logging, tracing, and monitoring AI interactions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Experiments" icon="flask" href="/api-reference/experiments/create">
    Endpoints for creating and managing experiments
  </Card>
  <Card title="Datasets" icon="database" href="/api-reference/datasets/get">
    Endpoints to interact with datasets
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Started

Before using the API, you'll need to:

1. **Obtain an API Key**: All API requests require authentication using your API key
2. **Understand Base URL**: All API requests are made to `https://api.getpraxis.ai`
3. **Review Authentication**: See our [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication) for details on how to use your API key

## Using the API

The praxis API follows RESTful principles with these standard conventions:

- All requests and responses use JSON format
- HTTP status codes indicate success or failure of requests
- Error responses include a consistent structure with error details
- Rate limits apply to protect the stability of the service

### Example Request

```bash
curl https://api.getpraxis.ai/prompts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "slug": "welcome-message",
    "tag": "production"
  }'
```

## API vs SDK

While the API gives you direct access to praxis's capabilities, we also offer SDKs for TypeScript/JavaScript and Python that provide a more convenient, language-specific interface.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="API Benefits" icon="terminal">
    - Direct access to all praxis features
    - Language-agnostic integration
    - Fine-grained control over requests and responses
    - Useful for custom integrations and platforms
  </Card>
  <Card title="SDK Benefits" icon="code">
    - Higher-level abstractions
    - Type safety and autocomplete
    - Built-in error handling
    - Automatic retries and caching
    - Simplified authentication
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

For most use cases, we recommend using our [SDKs](/sdk-overview), but the API is available for scenarios where direct access is preferred.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

- `2xx` codes indicate success
- `4xx` codes indicate client errors (invalid requests)
- `5xx` codes indicate server errors
