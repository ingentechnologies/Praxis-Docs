Praxis AI is a subscription based service with a free plan and several paid plans. When you pay for a subscription you get access to more features, and more credits. You need credits to send messages in Lovable.

### Named User Subscription

The **Named User Subscription** model is an annual contract that allows Client to purchase a per named user subscription that can be used anytime, anywhere, with an aggregated number of maximum credits based on the size of the population; calculated as one thousand (1,000) credits x number of named users. For example, a population of 500 named users would have a combined 500,000 credits to be used among all users each year.

Below is the volume breakdown:

| **Tier** | **Users**        | **Description**                    |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1        | Up to 1,000      | Annual subscription per named user |
| 2        | 1,001 to 5,000   | Annual subscription per named user |
| 3        | 5,0001 to 10,000 | Annual subscription per named user |
| 4        | 10,001 to 15,000 | Annual subscription per named user |
| 5        | 15,001 to 50,000 | Annual subscription per named user |
| 6        | 50,001 to 75,000 | Annual subscription per named user |
| 7        | 75,000\+         | Annual subscription per named user |

### Per Credit Usage

The **Per Credit Usage** model allows you to buy bundles of credits and apply them to digital twins throughout the organization. Each user or administrator interaction typically consumes 1 credit (sometimes more credits for more complex queries).

Here is the volume breakdown:

| **Tier** | **Credits** | **Description**                          |
