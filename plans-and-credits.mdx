    **Digital Twin Use**
    Credits added to your digital twin can be pooled and shared among all members of the digital twin community. When this sharing feature is enabled, users will automatically draw from the pooled credit balance instead of consuming their individual personal credits, creating a collaborative resource system that benefits the entire group.

    <Tip>
        Digital twins can be configured to either pool credits on behalf of their members or operate without credit pooling, requiring members to rely on their own personal credit balances. When pooling is disabled, each user must maintain and consume their individual credits for accessing services and features within the digital twin environment.
