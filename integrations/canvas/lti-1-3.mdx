Just recently Canvas added support for the Dynamic Registration of the LTI Advantage . This is a 1 step process for the registration of LTI Tools.

It enables Praxis AI to offer a simplified onboarding process for our LTI solution. The process is described in this document. 

It allows: 

Administrators to register Pria as an LTI tool in just 1 click and
Faculty Staff to create a digital twin for every placement of Pria in their course
Adding Pria to Canvas (Administration)

This process needs to be done just once for your Canvas instance. 

Developer Keys

Log into your canvas instance, then go to the Admin -> Developer Keys section 

Under the Developer Key menu, select LTI Registration 

For URL, enter 
https://prialti.praxislxp.com/register, then click Continue 


In the Register App modal, click Enable and Close to accept the default (or optionally, update the name of the placement to “Pria, Praxis AI”. This is the name that teachers will see when placing Pria in their course).


These are all the placements offered by the dynamic registration process.


Click Enabled and Close

Your new Pria LTI instance has been created: 

Copy the Client ID to your clipboard. The example here is: 243790000000000223
Manual Registration

As of July 2024, Canvas doesn’t offer to add or placements or edit the custom properties after the LTI component is installed through Dynamic registration.

Therefore, the manual process is possible if you want to use a specific instance of Pria (public institution id) or better control the placements, such as to take advantage of the new ‘top_navigation’ placement, that places Pria in a drawer, similar to the wiki_page,

In the Developer Keys, create a new LTI Key, and setup the properties as below:



In Key Name, write Pria LTI

In Owner Email, write the admin email

In Redirect URLs, add these:

https://prialti.praxislxp.com
https://prialti.praxislxp.com/resources
https://prialti.praxislxp.com/launch

In the Method, select Paste Json.

Here is the JSON you can use to enter the configuration manually:

Update your priainstitutionid custom property to a valid instance id or leave AS IS to use the Digital Twin

After pasting the JSON, and when you toggle back to Manual Entry, you will see that the placements include the new top_navigation


A complete guide to the manual setup is available on a Google Doc at

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-HSJTOIjg9C5LFIVeO0bw_Ntnc0rOyKe9I-5djf8L3M/edit?usp=sharing

Registering the App 

Go to the Admin -> Settings -> Apps and click the View App Configuration to add the component to your instance. 

In the App List screen, click on + App to add an application

In the Add App modal, select By Client ID 

Paste the Client ID of Pria you copied in the clipboard in the step above, ex: 243790000000000223 

Canvas will find the LTI Application corresponding to the client ID you entered. 
In the Add App modal, click Install


Note: If you re-install Pria, you will see this dialog. You can click Yes to install the new instance. This instance is different from the previous one since this new instance supports the new onboarding Digital Twin workflow.


Your Pria LTI application is now installed in your instance. It takes several minutes for Canvas to make this application available as a placement. 

Create your new Digital Twin 

This process is for Teachers, and expects that Pria has been registered as an LTI Application by your Administrator through the steps above.

Placing Pria in your Course

To start, go to your Dashboard then select your course. 

In your course, click on the + button inside a module to Add Pria as an activity 

In the Add Item to Module modal dialog, select External Tool 

Select Pria LTI from the list of LTI Tools

In the Link Resource modal, select PRIA, Praxis AI, then click the Submit button 

Back in the Add Item module, click the Add Item button 

Pria has been added to your module. Click on Pria to launch.

Pria will open up unless it has been defined to launch in a separate window.

Create your Digital Twin

When Pria is launched for the first time by an administrator or teacher, click on the + Digital Twin button to create new and personalized instance or Pria

In the New Digital Twin dialog, enter 
a name for your twin, ex: Bob, 
a picture URL that is accessible on the internet (without CORS issues), and 
a picture to use for large backgrounds
An A.I. prompt that personalizes your character (more information is available in the Faculty Guide )
Click Let’s GO to finish the creation of your new instance.


You are now in your digital twin instance: 

Congratulations, you just created your very first digital twin. 
Anytime you or your students will click on Pria, they will access this instance directly. 

When you place Pria LTI in another course, or create a different instance, the onboarding wizard will offer to reuse one of your instances or create a new one for this placement. 

Selecting an existing instance will associate this placement to the instance. This can not be changed later. To change it, remove the Pria activity, and create a new one. 

More Personalisation Options

More information on Admin functions is available in the Faculty Guide to your Digital Twin at 

https://learning.praxislxp.com/praxis/faculty-guide-to-your-digital-twin/#GPT_and_Personalization

Click on the GPT and Personalization Tab. This page is where you can update any personalizations for your digital twin. 


Don’t forget to click the Update button to save your changes.

Student Access

 Students will automatically join your digital twin once you have placed Pria in your course, launched and completed the creation wizard the first time. 
If your student attempt to access Pria, but your instance has not been created, they will receive this message 

When the browser is running in Incognito mode, or Cookies are been blocked,due to recent updates in browsers and how they handle third party cookies, it may prevent LTI from launching properly.

As a result you can receive an error similar to the one below:


You may need to allow third party cookies and retry.
