Once you have installed Pria onto your web site (or LMS such as Canvas) you can communicate to Pria through Javascript. This document describes how to make requests to Pria and receive responses from Pria, without requiring the Pria UI

There are two ways to integrate Praxis: [Embed](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [SDK](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Embed

Install Pria on your Website using the custom SDK https://pria.praxislxp.com/pria-sdk-web.js or follow this guide to install Pria as a Theme onto Canvas https://learning.praxislxp.com/praxis/pria-custom-theme-canvas-install-guide .

Once your instance is configured, and to hide the pria UI, set the display options of the priasdk to noUI=true value


[SDK Playground](https://pria.praxislxp.com/test_sdk.html)

Once your instance is configured, and to hide the pria UI, set the display options of the priasdk to `noUI=true` value

```javascript
    var displayOptions = {
        fullScreen: false, // True for expanded in full screen
        openOnLoad: false, // True to open Pria immediately when loaded 
        buttonWidth: '80px', // Size of the button containing the Pria Logo
        buttonPosition: 'fixed', // Determine the position of the button (fixed, relative, sticky)
        buttonPositionRight: '20px', // Position of the button relative to the right edge of the screen
        buttonPositionBottom: '20px', // Position of the button relative to the bottom edge of the screen
        buttonNoBounce: true,  // Determine wether the button will not bounce when Pria is closed
        priaContainerId: '', // Id of the container receiving pria window (default empty uses BODY)
        buttonContainerId: '', // Id of the container receiving the button (default empty uses BODY)
        allowPop: false, // true to show the button and pop Pria out the containing iFrame 
        noUI: false // true to disable the UI. Pria is still accessible through the Javascript SDK
    }

```

### Global Window Object
Pria SDK is available as a window global object and contains the following functions:

```javascript
const pria = {
    load: priasdk,
    send: priaSend,
    subscribe: priaSubscribe,
    unsubscribe: priaUnsubscribe,
    setVisible: priaSetVisible,
    version: 1
}

// support for the browser and nodejs
if (isNode) {
    module.exports = { priasdk, pria }
} else {
    window.priasdk = priasdk;
    window.pria = pria;
}

```


### Make a simple request
To send a request to Pria, ise the send(0 function.

When Pria is installed and running, Pria will be available in your page like the example below:


n this example features Pria named as ‚ÄòScarlet‚Äô which is a custom Digital Twin.

At the time of this writing, Pria send() API function SDK supports the following commands:

post.message : Sends a text message to Pria

convo.start: Sends a request to start the Conversational feature Speech to Speech

convo.stop: Sends a request to stop the Conversational feature Speech to Speech

Anywhere in the DOM of your web page, you can send requests to Pria using a simple Javascript code like this:

```javascript
const request = {
	command: 'post.message',
	inputs: ['How are you?','Today is my birthday !'],
}

pria.send(request)
```

### Convo Mode Request

To start the Convo feature, you can use the following code:
```javascript
const request = {
    command: 'convo.start'
}
pria.send(request)
```

The function pria.send may throw errors such as: ‚ÄúConnect Pria first, then retry‚Äù, and ‚ÄúFunction requires valid JSON.‚Äù

The SDK uses the identity of the user currently connected to the digital twin.

Pria will only respond when the digital is properly configured and fully connected.


### Receive responses

To receive a response from Pria, you must subscribe first.

This is done using the pria.subscribe function like the following example:

```javascript
const gotResponseFromPria = (response) => {
    ....
}
pria.subscribe(gotResponseFromPria)
```

### Example Response
