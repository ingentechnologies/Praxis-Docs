## Instance Management

Instances are the core of your Praxis AI experience, allowing you to manage and interact with various digital twins.

<Note>
  This feature is only available for **Digital Twin Instance Admins**
</Note>

Hereâ€™s how you can effectively manage instances:

![Admin Configurations Main Ui Gi](/images/admin-configurations-main-ui.gif)

Start by clicking the <Icon icon="house-chimney" /> Admin dashboard, located at the top of the main user interface.

The **Instances** tab displays all instances your user is entitled to manage and also allows you to create a new instance if you are entitled to do so.

## Integrations

The **Integrations** section allows you to connect your instance with various platforms and services. Here are the key integrations you can set up:

The Public Authorized URLS: contains the list of URLS authorized to access your instance. If you integrate with canvas the URLs below are a good example:

```
https://<your_school>.instructure.com
https://<your_school>.beta.instructure.com
https://canvas.instructure.com
```

Any inbound request is authorized if the origin comes from one of these URLS.

The Canvas Client ID and Secret are used to connect your instance to Canvas.

Similarly, the Kaltura Partner ID, Secret, Admin or User and User ID fields are used to connect your instance to the Kaltura Video Platform.

LTI Contexts are automatically populated when you decide to connect an LTI Placement to a digital twin instance. This place is remembered so that next time the system knows what instance to launch when you click on Pria through LTI or the Theme based integration for Canvas.

If you want to remove the placement, a.k.a. disconnect the LTI from the digital twin, you may remove the placement from this list, or simply go to your profile page
