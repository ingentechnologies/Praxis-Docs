## Instance Management
Instances are the core of your Praxis AI experience, allowing you to manage and interact with various digital twins. Here’s how you can effectively manage instances:

The Instances TAB display all instances your user is entitled to manage and also allows you to create a new instance if you are entitled to do so.

### Viewing Instances

- **List of Instances**: The Instances tab displays all instances you have access to. Each instance is listed with its name, status, and other relevant details.
- **Instance Details**: Clicking on an instance will provide you with detailed information, including its configuration, members, and activity logs.



## Configuration and Integrations

## Configuration
The **Configuration** section allows you to manage the settings of your instance. Here are the key features you can configure:



- **Name:** The name of your instance. It is a good practice to stay consistent with the naming, for example:

```
For an instance in Canvas: instance_name.school_name.instructure.com

For an instance in Praxis LXP: instance_name.learning.praxislxp.com
```


<Note>Credits: New instances get 50 credits to get started, you can purchase credits https://pria.praxislxp.com/my-profile/pricing or contact your Institution’s IT administrator.</Note>

- **Status:** Active when the instance is available for you and users to use, Inactive otherwise.

- **Public ID:** is automatically generated for your instance upon creation, and is used for integration purposes. Do not share with anyone. It is referred by public institution id, or simply instance id.

- **Pool Credits:** Enable Pool Credits to share the credits of your instance with users. Each interaction consumes 1 or 2 credits (depending on the complexity). Depending on your contractual agreements, credits need to be replenished when depleted to allow learners to continue interacting with your instance.

- **Grant Entitlements to New Admins:** When creating a new digital twin, select the Grant Entitlements feature to ensure that all admin who are added to your digital twin will be able to acces the admin dashboard. Entitlements not only control dashboard visibility but also determine which features the admin can customize and use. By enabling this feature, each new admin will automatically be granted all of the entitlements. If you have specific questions about entitlements, email darianne@praxis-ai.com

- **Enable Moderation:** By enabling this feature, Pria will automatically monitor and flag inappropriate content in user interactions. Each time an inappropriate conversation is detected, an alert will be sent to the designated instance contact email.

- **Don't prompt to Personalize:** Remove the initial popup that prompts administrators to personalize your instance (a.k.a digital twin). You can always personalize your instance by filling out the onboarding questions as explained in the following chapters.

- **Use Location:** This feature allows for more accurate and relevant responses, particularly for location-dependent queries such as local services, weather updates, or campus-specific information. By granting access to your location data, you optimize Pria’s functionality, ensuring you receive the most up-to-date and location-appropriate assistance.

- **Enable Convo:** This feature allows for real-time speech communication with the digital twin. When activated, this feature utilizes advanced speech recognition technology to accurately capture user voice input, process it through natural language understanding algorithms, and generate appropriate verbal responses through high-quality text-to-speech synthesis.

- **Contact Email:** Add your email or if there are multiple owners, add them in the Owners Email. It is used to provide help and support when needed, and identifies YOU or a group of you as the owners of the instance.


## Integrations
The **Integrations** section allows you to connect your instance with various platforms and services. Here are the key integrations you can set up:

The Public Authorized URLS: contains the list of URLS authorized to access your instance. If you integrate with canvas the URLs below are a good example:

```
https://<your_school>.instructure.com
https://<your_school>.beta.instructure.com
https://canvas.instructure.com
```

Any inbound request is authorized if the origin comes from one of these URLS.

The Canvas Client ID and Secret are used to connect your instance to Canvas.

Similarly, the Kaltura Partner ID, Secret, Admin or User and User ID fields are used to connect your instance to the Kaltura Video Platform.

LTI Contexts are automatically populated when you decide to connect an LTI Placement to a digital twin instance. This place is remembered so that next time the system knows what instance to launch when you click on Pria through LTI or the Theme based integration for Canvas.

If you want to remove the placement, a.k.a. disconnect the LTI from the digital twin, you may remove the placement from this list, or simply go to your profile page
