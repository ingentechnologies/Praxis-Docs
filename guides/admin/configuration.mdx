## Instance Management

Instances are the core of your Praxis AI experience, allowing you to manage and interact with various digital twins.

<Note>
  This feature is only available for **Digital Twin Instance Admins**
</Note>

Hereâ€™s how you can effectively manage instances:

![Admin Configurations Main Ui Gi](/images/admin-configurations-main-ui.gif)

Start by clicking the <Icon icon="house-chimney" /> Admin dashboard, located at the top of the main user interface.

The **Instances** tab displays all instances your user is entitled to manage and also allows you to create a new instance if you are entitled to do so.

## Configuration

The **Configuration** section allows you to manage your instance settings. Configure these key features to optimize your digital twin's performance and accessibility.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Name">
    Set your instance name using consistent naming conventions:

    ```
    Canvas integration: instance_name.school_name.instructure.com
    Praxis LXP integration: instance_name.praxislxp.com
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credits">
    New instances receive 50 starter credits. Purchase additional credits at https://pria.praxislxp.com/my-profile/pricing or contact your institution's IT administrator for enterprise options.

## Integrations

![Configurations Integrations Main Web](/images/configurations-integrations-main.webp)

The **Integrations** section enables you to connect your digital twin instance with various platforms and services to extend functionality and streamline workflows.

### **Public Authorized URLs**

Configure the URLs authorized to access your instance for secure integration with external platforms.

**Example for Canvas Integration:**

```
https://<your_school>.instructure.com
https://<your_school>.beta.instructure.com
https://canvas.instructure.com
```

All inbound requests are validated against this authorized URL list. Only requests originating from these URLs will be permitted to access your instance.

### **LTI Contexts**

LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) contexts are automatically populated when you connect an LTI placement to your digital twin instance.

**Key Features:**

- **Automatic Population**: Contexts are created when LTI placements are established
- **Instance Memory**: The system remembers which instance to launch when accessing your digital twin through LTI or Canvas theme-based integration
- **Easy Management**: Remove placements directly from this list or through your profile page

**To disconnect an LTI integration:**

1. Remove the placement from the LTI Contexts list, or
2. Navigate to your profile page for additional management options

### Canvas

The Canvas Client ID and Secret are used to connect your digital twin instance to Canvas. If these keys are not configured, your digital twin will not be able to search through Canvas as reference material.

<Info>
  These keys will be configured by your Canvas Administrator. If you are a Canvas administrator and would like guidance, refer to this [guide](https://docs.praxis-ai.com/integrations/canvas/smartsearch).
</Info>

### Kaltura

Similarly, the Kaltura Partner ID, Secret, Admin or User and User ID fields are used to connect your instance to the Kaltura Video Platform.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Connect AWS services to extend your digital twin's capabilities.

### API Keys

Configure Large Language Model (LLM) API keys to use your own credits and customize AI behavior.

**Supported Providers:**

- OpenAI GPT models
- Anthropic Claude
- Google Gemini
- Other compatible LLM services

### Security Considerations

- **URL Validation**: Only authorized URLs can access your instance
- **Credential Management**: All API keys and secrets are encrypted and stored securely
- **Access Control**: Integration permissions are tied to your user entitlements
- **Audit Trail**: All integration activities are logged for security monitoring
