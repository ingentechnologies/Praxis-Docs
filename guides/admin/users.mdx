When your instance is integrated through Canvas or other SDK, users are automatically signed in and registered. Use this page to list all users for a specific instance, or narrow the search by account type or sections of the user name or email.

### User List
The user list shows all users registered in the instance. You can search by name or email, and filter by account type.
### User Details
Click on a user to see their details, including their account type, email, and the sections they are enrolled in. You can also see their activity history and any sessions they have participated in.  
### User Actions
You can perform several actions on a user:
- **Edit User**: Change the user's account type or email.
- **Delete User**: Remove the user from the instance.
- **View Sessions**: See the sessions the user has participated in.
- **View History**: Access the user's activity history.

### Add User
To add a new user, click the "Add User" button. You will need to provide the user's name, email, and account type. Once added, the user will receive an email with instructions on how to access the instance.
### Bulk Actions
You can perform bulk actions on users by selecting multiple users from the list. The available actions include:
- **Delete Selected Users**: Remove multiple users at once.
- **Change Account Type**: Update the account type for multiple users simultaneously.

Users can have different permissions based on their account type. The available account types are:
- **Admin**: Full access to manage the instance, including user management and configuration.

- **Guest**: Limited access, typically for users who are not registered but need to view content.

Users can receive notifications about important updates, such as new sessions, changes to their account, or other relevant information. You can manage user notifications in the user settings section.
### User Support
If users encounter issues or have questions, they can access support resources directly from their user profile.
### User Privacy
We take user privacy seriously. All user data is stored securely, and users can manage their privacy settings from their profile. Users can choose to delete their account or request data deletion at any time.
### User Analytics
You can view user analytics to understand user engagement and activity within the instance. This includes metrics such as session participation, user activity history, and overall user engagement trends.
