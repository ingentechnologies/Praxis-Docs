## Instance Management
Instances are the core of your Praxis AI experience, allowing you to manage and interact with various digital twins. Here’s how you can effectively manage instances:

The Instances TAB display all instances your user is entitled to manage and also allows you to create a new instance if you are entitled to do so.
![Instances Interface](/images/guides/admin/instances.webp)



### Viewing Instances

- **List of Instances**: The Instances tab displays all instances you have access to. Each instance is listed with its name, status, and other relevant details.
- **Instance Details**: Clicking on an instance will provide you with detailed information, including its configuration, members, and activity logs.



## Configuration and Integrations

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Configuration" icon="message">



- **Name:** The name of your instance. It is a good practice to stay consistent with the naming, for example:

```
For an instance in Canvas: instance_name.school_name.instructure.com

For an instance in Praxis LXP: instance_name.learning.praxislxp.com
```


<Note>Credits: New instances get 50 credits to get started, you can purchase credits https://pria.praxislxp.com/my-profile/pricing or contact your Institution’s IT administrator.</Note>

- **Status:** Active when the instance is available for you and users to use, Inactive otherwise.

- **Public ID:** is automatically generated for your instance upon creation, and is used for integration purposes. Do not share with anyone. It is referred by public institution id, or simply instance id.

- **Pool Credits:** Enable Pool Credits to share the credits of your instance with users. Each interaction consumes 1 or 2 credits (depending on the complexity). Depending on your contractual agreements, credits need to be replenished when depleted to allow learners to continue interacting with your instance.

- **Grant Entitlements to New Admins:** When creating a new digital twin, select the Grant Entitlements feature to ensure that all admin who are added to your digital twin will be able to acces the admin dashboard. Entitlements not only control dashboard visibility but also determine which features the admin can customize and use. By enabling this feature, each new admin will automatically be granted all of the entitlements. If you have specific questions about entitlements, email darianne@praxis-ai.com

- **Enable Moderation:** By enabling this feature, Pria will automatically monitor and flag inappropriate content in user interactions. Each time an inappropriate conversation is detected, an alert will be sent to the designated instance contact email.

- **Don't prompt to Personalize:** Remove the initial popup that prompts administrators to personalize your instance (a.k.a digital twin). You can always personalize your instance by filling out the onboarding questions as explained in the following chapters.

- **Use Location:** This feature allows for more accurate and relevant responses, particularly for location-dependent queries such as local services, weather updates, or campus-specific information. By granting access to your location data, you optimize Pria’s functionality, ensuring you receive the most up-to-date and location-appropriate assistance.

- **Enable Convo:** This feature allows for real-time speech communication with the digital twin. When activated, this feature utilizes advanced speech recognition technology to accurately capture user voice input, process it through natural language understanding algorithms, and generate appropriate verbal responses through high-quality text-to-speech synthesis.

- **Contact Email:** Add your email or if there are multiple owners, add them in the Owners Email. It is used to provide help and support when needed, and identifies YOU or a group of you as the owners of the instance.

<Accordion title="Integrations" icon="message">

The Public Authorized URLS: contains the list of URLS authorized to access your instance. If you integrate with canvas the URLs below are a good example:

```
https://<your_school>.instructure.com
https://<your_school>.beta.instructure.com
https://canvas.instructure.com
```

Any inbound request is authorized if the origin comes from one of these URLS.

The Canvas Client ID and Secret are used to connect your instance to Canvas.

Similarly, the Kaltura Partner ID, Secret, Admin or User and User ID fields are used to connect your instance to the Kaltura Video Platform.

LTI Contexts are automatically populated when you decide to connect an LTI Placement to a digital twin instance. This place is remembered so that next time the system knows what instance to launch when you click on Pria through LTI or the Theme based integration for Canvas.

If you want to remove the placement, a.k.a. disconnect the LTI from the digital twin, you may remove the placement from this list, or simply go to your profile page

## Personalization and AI Models

Your instance can be personalized to better fit the needs of your users in the **Personalization and AI Models** tab. This includes customizing the AI models used for different tasks, as well as adjusting the parameters that govern their behavior.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Admin"></Step>
  <Step title="Click Instances"></Step>
  <Step title="Click Edit"></Step>
  <Step title="Click Personalization and AI Models"></Step>
</Steps>





By following these steps, your digital assistant will now function as your digital twin, responding and acting as if they were you. This personalization enhances the interaction experience, making it more authentic and aligned with your unique style.

The AI prompt should be entered in natural language, and should be clear, concise and unambiguous.

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

Retrieval Augmented Generation is a core functionality of your digital twin. It means that your digital twin is capable of searching documents you have uploaded for articles of content relevant to the conversation and add them during your interaction with the large language model. This technique allows you to source the content to trusted material you control.

RAG is enabled by default and is at work when you upload a file in your private IP Vault, and when you select the files to include in the conversation.


To better understand the k-NN Vector Score %, here is a breakdown:


File Upload Process:
When you upload a file to your instance, the content is broken down into sections.
Each section is converted into a “Vector Embedding”.
Question Processing:
When a learner asks a question, it is also turned into a Vector Embedding.
Relevance Matching:
The system uses the Euclidean k-NN (k-nearest neighbors) algorithm to compare the question’s embedding with the embeddings of the file sections.
Sections are ranked based on how closely they match the question’s embedding, using a relevance score.
Default Selection:
By default, the system selects the top 3 sections with relevance scores above 35%.
Adjustable Threshold:
You can adjust the threshold:
Increase it for stricter selection criteria.
Lower it to include sections that might be less relevant to the question.
Disable File Upload for Students: You may choose to disable File upload to prevent users from uploading files. Don’t worry, as administrator, you can still upload files for your instance. This is covered in a section on course material later in this guide.

### GPT Models

You can select the AI Models. these models have various performance and feature sets.


Here are some examples of models available for conversation:


The — default model– always uses the latest version available with the highest level of intelligence and performance. We recommend that you use the default.

More information on the different AI Models from OpenAI is available at: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview


More informations on models from Amazon Bedrock at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.html





## Agents and Trusted Sources
Your instance uses tools to assist the AI Bot with specific functionality, like memory, picture analysis and generation, access to the internet for real-time information, youtube videos and audio transcripts, and many more.
Use this page to select which tools you wish to disable (if any) for your instance. By default all tools are enabled.

### List of Tools

This is the list of tools that explains what they do and provides some examples on how to use them. For live examples of what Pria can do, consult the Getting Started Guide

<Note>The AI will automatically choose which tool from this custom list to use to use through each conversation.</Note>
