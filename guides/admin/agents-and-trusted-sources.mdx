The Agents and Trusted Sources tab allows you to manage the AI tools available in your instance. This includes enabling or disabling specific tools that assist the AI Bot in performing various tasks.

Your instance uses tools to assist the AI Bot with specific functionality, like memory, picture analysis and generation, access to the internet for real-time information, youtube videos and audio transcripts, and many more.
Use this page to select which tools you wish to disable (if any) for your instance. By default all tools are enabled.
