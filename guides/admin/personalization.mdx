## Digital Twin Instructions

Creating effective digital twin instructions is crucial for ensuring your AI assistant behaves authentically and provides valuable interactions. Follow these comprehensive guidelines:

#### 1. Framework-Based Approach

**Use CRISPE Framework:**

- **C**ontext: Provide background information about your role, expertise, and environment
- **R**ole: Define who the digital twin represents and their primary function
- **I**nstructions: Give clear, specific directions on how to behave and respond
- **S**pecifics: Include detailed preferences, communication style, and decision-making patterns
- **P**arameters: Set boundaries and limitations for the digital twin's responses
- **E**xamples: Provide sample responses or scenarios to illustrate expected behavior

**Apply ALERT Framework:**

- **A**ction: Define what actions the digital twin should take
- **L**imitations: Set clear boundaries on what it should not do
- **E**xamples: Provide concrete examples of desired responses
- **R**ole: Establish the digital twin's identity and expertise
- **T**one: Specify the communication style and personality

#### 2. Specificity and Clarity

<Tip>
  The more specific you are, the better your digital twin will perform. Vague instructions lead to inconsistent responses.
</Tip>

**Be Explicit About:**

- **Communication Style**: Formal vs. casual, technical vs. accessible, brief vs. detailed
- **Expertise Areas**: List specific domains where the digital twin should demonstrate knowledge
- **Decision-Making Process**: How the digital twin should approach problems and make recommendations
- **Personality Traits**: Professional demeanor, humor level, empathy, assertiveness
- **Response Structure**: Preferred formats for different types of questions

**Example of Specific Instructions:**

```
When answering technical questions, always:
1. Start with a brief, direct answer
2. Provide detailed explanation with examples
3. Include relevant best practices
4. Suggest next steps or related resources
5. Use bullet points for complex information
```

#### 3. Content Source Prioritization

**Establish Clear Hierarchy:**

```
Priority Order for Information Sources:
1. User's uploaded documents and files (RAG material)
2. Specific expertise knowledge relevant to your role
3. General knowledge base
4. External research (when explicitly requested)
```

<Note>
  Always reference RAG material first when available. This ensures responses are based on your specific knowledge and documents rather than generic information.
</Note>

#### 4. Behavioral Guidelines

**Define Response Patterns:**

- **Question Handling**: How to approach different types of inquiries
- **Uncertainty Management**: What to do when information is unclear or unavailable
- **Escalation Procedures**: When to suggest human intervention or additional resources
- **Follow-up Actions**: How to continue conversations and build on previous interactions

**Example Behavioral Instructions:**

```
When faced with ambiguous questions:
- Ask clarifying questions before providing answers
- Offer multiple interpretations if appropriate
- Suggest the most likely intended meaning
- Always confirm understanding before proceeding
```

#### 5. Domain-Specific Expertise

**Include Relevant Specializations:**

- **Industry Knowledge**: Specific sectors, regulations, best practices
- **Technical Skills**: Software, methodologies, frameworks you're familiar with
- **Soft Skills**: Leadership style, communication preferences, problem-solving approach
- **Experience Context**: Years of experience, notable projects, key achievements

#### 6. Interaction Preferences

**Specify How to Engage:**

- **Question Types**: Preferred formats for receiving information
- **Response Length**: When to be concise vs. comprehensive
- **Visual Elements**: Use of charts, diagrams, examples
- **Follow-up Style**: Proactive suggestions vs. reactive responses

#### 7. Ethical and Professional Boundaries

**Establish Clear Limits:**

- **Confidentiality**: What information should never be shared
- **Professional Standards**: Industry-specific ethical guidelines
- **Personal Boundaries**: Topics or approaches to avoid
- **Accuracy Requirements**: When to verify information vs. provide general guidance

#### 8. Continuous Improvement Instructions

**Include Adaptation Guidelines:**

```
Learning and Adaptation:
- Pay attention to user feedback and adjust responses accordingly
- Note frequently asked questions and improve standard responses
- Identify knowledge gaps and suggest areas for additional training
- Maintain consistency while allowing for natural conversation flow
```
