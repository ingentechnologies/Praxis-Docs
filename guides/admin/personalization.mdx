These questions will guide the AI in understanding your preferences, communication style, and how you would respond in various situations. This personalization is key to creating a more authentic and effective digital assistant.

By following these steps, your digital assistant will now function as your digital twin, responding and acting as if they were you. This personalization enhances the interaction experience, making it more authentic and aligned with your unique style.
