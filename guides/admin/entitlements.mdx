The Entitlements tab serves as your central control panel for managing role-based permissions within your account. This powerful feature allows you to customize access levels for different user types, ensuring appropriate system access based on organizational roles and responsibilities.

You can configure permissions to prevent users from accessing the administrative dashboard, limiting their interaction to only the learning environment.

For teaching assistants, you can grant selective administrative privileges—such as viewing user activity history—while restricting other administrative functions like user management or digital twin configuration.

This granular permission system ensures that each user type has exactly the access they need to fulfill their role, without exposing sensitive system controls or functionality beyond their requirements.
