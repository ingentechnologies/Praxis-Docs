## Conversation History

Each dialogue containing your question and my answer is recorded and added into the conversation history. The conversation history has several useful buttons to help you navigate the history as well as adding or removing some dialogues to/from your list of favorites.


The following functions are available:

1. Open the side tab to navigate your conversations
2. Make your conversation appear larger or smaller
3. Click the star to add the conversation to your favorites

Marking a dialogue as a Favorite allows you to quickly go back to it when you need.

Conversations help you organize your interactions with Pria. Each time you start a new chat through assistants or switch between Canvas classes using the same digital twin, a new conversation is created. You can rename, sort by date, or clear these conversations as needed.

Favorites allow you to bookmark and easily access important responses. When you click the star icon on any response, it’s saved to your Favorites list for quick reference later. Clicking on a favorite will help you jump directly to it.

Settings allow you to customize your Pria experience by adjusting three key options: the AI Conversation Model, the maximum number of dialogues displayed, and the remember history for Pria.

Max Dialogues:	Determine the maximum number of dialog to load in your history pane. Too many dialogs may impact performance of the UI, while not enough limit the number of dialogs you can scroll back to. USe 25 by default.
Remember History:	This setting determines the number of dialogues I can remember in each conversation, allowing me to recall your previous questions and answers. This is particularly important during interactions that require analyzing your past responses, such as the Conversational Assessment or Interview process.

A minimum value of 6 is required for the Conversational Assessment. While this setting enhances the context of each interaction, it may also consume additional credits. Therefore, we recommend keeping it between 3 and 6 as needed.
