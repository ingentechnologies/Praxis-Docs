## What does Convo Mode do?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Natural Dialogue Flow" icon="comments">
    Your digital twin knows how to have actual conversations. It waits for you
    to finish your thoughts before jumping in, remembers what you've been
    talking about, and lets you ask follow-up questions without having to repeat
    yourself.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Voice Capabilities" icon="microphone">
    When you speak, your words appear as text right away. When your digital twin
    responds, you'll hear it speak back to you with a natural-sounding voice.
    The more you use it, the better it gets at understanding how you talk.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multilingual Support" icon="globe">
    Switch between languages right in the middle of a conversation. Your digital
    twin will catch on and switch with you, keeping track of what you were
    talking about.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cultural Adaptation" icon="users">
    It even understands when bilingual speakers naturally mix languages, and it
    adapts its responses to fit the cultural context of whatever language you're
    using.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Knowledge Integration" icon="brain">
    Your AI assistant automatically references your uploaded documents and
    custom-built assistants during conversations, providing personalized and
    contextually relevant responses.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audio Transcriptions" icon="file-text">
    All voice conversations are automatically saved as searchable transcript
    files that you can access, review, and reference at any time.
