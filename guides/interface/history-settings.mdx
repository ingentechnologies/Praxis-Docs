### Navigation Panel Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Conversations" icon="comments">
    **Organize Your AI Interactions**

    Conversations automatically organize your interactions with Pria. Each time you:

    - Start a new chat through assistants
    - Switch between Canvas classes using the same digital twin
    - Begin a specialized session (like Conversational Assessment)

    A new conversation thread is created for better organization.

    **Management Options:**

    - ‚úèÔ∏è Rename conversations for easy identification
    - üìÖ Sort by creation date
    - üóëÔ∏è Clear conversations when no longer needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Favorites" icon="star">
    **Bookmark Important Responses**

    Save valuable AI responses for quick future reference:

    1. **Save**: Click the ‚≠ê star icon on any response
    2. **Access**: Find all favorites in this dedicated section
    3. **Navigate**: Click any favorite to jump directly to that conversation

    <Tip>
      Use favorites to bookmark key insights, important explanations, or reference materials you'll need again.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Settings" icon="gear">
    **Customize Your AI Experience**

    Fine-tune three critical settings for optimal performance:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="AI Model">
        **AI Conversation Model**

        Select the AI model that best fits your needs and usage patterns.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Max Dialogues">
        **Maximum Dialogues Display**

        - **Purpose**: Controls how many dialogue pairs load in your history
        - **Default**: 25 dialogues
        - **Balance**: Too many may slow performance; too few limits scrollback access
        - **Recommendation**: Adjust based on your device performance and needs
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Remember History">
        **AI Memory Span**

        - **Function**: Determines how many previous dialogues the AI remembers
        - **Impact**: Enables context-aware responses and follow-up questions
        - **Range**: 3-6 recommended for optimal balance
        - **Special Requirements**: Minimum of 6 needed for Conversational Assessment

        <Warning>
          Higher values provide better context but consume more credits. Find your optimal balance between context and cost.
        </Warning>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
