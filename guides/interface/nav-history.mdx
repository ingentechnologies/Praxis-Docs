<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Conversations" icon="message">
Conversations help you organize your interactions with Pria. Each time you start a new chat through assistants or switch between Canvas classes using the same digital twin, a new conversation is created. You can rename, sort by date, or clear these conversations as needed.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Favorites" icon="message">
Favorites allow you to bookmark and easily access important responses. When you click the star icon on any response, it’s saved to your Favorites list for quick reference later. Clicking on a favorite will help you jump directly to it.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Settings" icon="message">
Settings allow you to customize your Pria experience by adjusting three key options: the AI Conversation Model, the maximum number of dialogues displayed, and the remember history for Pria.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>





Max Dialogues:	Determine the maximum number of dialog to load in your history pane. Too many dialogs may impact performance of the UI, while not enough limit the number of dialogs you can scroll back to. USe 25 by default.
Remember History:	This setting determines the number of dialogues I can remember in each conversation, allowing me to recall your previous questions and answers. This is particularly important during interactions that require analyzing your past responses, such as the Conversational Assessment or Interview process.

A minimum value of 6 is required for the Conversational Assessment. While this setting enhances the context of each interaction, it may also consume additional credits. Therefore, we recommend keeping it between 3 and 6 as needed.



## Conversation History

Each dialogue containing your question and my answer is recorded and added into the conversation history. The conversation history has several useful buttons to help you navigate the history as well as adding or removing some dialogues to/from your list of favorites.

The following functions are available:

1. Open the side tab to navigate your conversations
2. Make your conversation appear larger or smaller
3. Click the star to add the conversation to your favorites

Marking a dialogue as a Favorite allows you to quickly go back to it when you need.

## Loading more history

## Listing Conversations

The conversations list displays the various interactions you've had with this Pria instance.


For example, a new conversation will be created when you initiate a fresh conversation with your conversational assessment assistant or switch between courses in Canvas that utilize the same Pria instance.

You can see which conversation you are in by looking at the top of the Pria dialogue.


The conversation list shows the name of the Course or Assistant used, the date it was created and how many dialogues this conversation has. You can mnage any conversation like below:


You can rename a conversation or delete it entirely if you are no longer using it.


<Danger>Note about Delete: Beware, this will delete this conversation history so only clear if you are Okay no longer referencing these dialogues.</Danger>
