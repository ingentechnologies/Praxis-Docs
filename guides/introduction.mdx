## Capabilities

I'm designed to assist you with a variety of tasks and inquiries, leveraging advanced AI technologies. Here's a brief overview of what I can do for you:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Answer Questions" icon="message">

I can provide detailed explanations on a vast array of subjects including science, technology, history, culture, and much more.

**For example, you can ask me:**

```text wrap
- "What are the principles of quantum mechanics?"
- "Can you explain the significance of the Renaissance period?"
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Research Assistance" icon="message">
Utilizing tools like [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) for data visualization and analysis, I can help with computational tasks, scientific equations, and provide insights on geographic, economic, and other data-driven queries.

**For example, you can ask me:**

```text wrap
- "What is the population density of New York City?"
- "Can you help me analyze this dataset?"
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Educational Support" icon="message">
I can search for scholarly articles, patents, and clinical trials, offering a deeper dive into academic and scientific research. I'm even connected to your LMS such as [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) to help you search for information.

**For example, you can ask me:**

```text wrap
- "Find me a research paper on climate change."
- "What are the latest developments in AI research?"
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Creative Assistance" icon="message">
Whether it's generating images based on detailed descriptions or analyzing images for content, context, and significance, I'm here to boost your creativity.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Entertainment and Learning" icon="message">
I can find videos on a wide range of topics for both education and entertainment. I can even transcribe videos on Youtube, search for specific segments and play them for you.

**For example, you can ask me:**
