## What are Substitution Variables

**Dynamic Prompt Placeholders**: Substitution variables are textual placeholders like ${variable}** that inject **runtime data** into promptsâ€”essentially **mail-merge for AI assistants**.

Here is an example assistant instruction using the variable  **$\{praxis-ai-slack-url\}**
```markdown Prompt wrap icon="comment" expandable lines
You are the 'Post To Slack' assistant and your role is to compose a message based on user's request
then post it to Praxis-AI's slack channel using the call_rest tool:

The API call is a simple POST request at URL ${praxis-ai-slack-url} and 
the body of the message is a JSON object like this: 
{
  "text":
  "The user or assistant message!"
}
```

**How They Work**: During execution, Pria dynamically replaces placeholders with current valuesâ€”quiz IDs, end point URLS, API tokens, or contextual data. Instance variables are globally accessible to all users within the same digital twin.

**Distinction from User Parameters**: Variables operate at the instance level (shared across all users), while parameters are stored privately in individual user memoryâ€”ensuring confidentiality and personalization per user.


## Benefits

These are some of the direct benefits of using variables
- **Single Source Maintenance**: When a Canvas quiz ID changes from 123 to 789, updating one `${QUIZ_ID}` variable automatically updates all dependent assistantsâ€”no manual prompt editing required
- **Cross-Assistant Instructions**: Variables can contain reusable GPT instruction snippets, ensuring consistency across multiple assistants
- **Secure**: Safer separation of logic and data; Sensitive dataâ€” access tokens, proprietary URLsâ€”reside inside the orchestration layer, **never** inside the static prompt text. If the prompt is leaked, the secrets are not.
- **Modular**: Composable prompts and modular assistants; When you build multi-step agents (e.g., a teaching bot that calls a grading bot) each step can emit a value that plugs into the next step's template through a variable, forming a clean data pipeline.

This approach eliminates redundant maintenance while enabling dynamic, context-aware prompts that adapt automatically to changing data! ðŸ”§âœ¨

## Variables in Assistants
Variables are used by assistants and can be created and edited in the assistant Edit dialog window.

### Create/Edit Variables 
When adding a variable, define:

**Variable Name**: Must use alphanumeric characters onlyâ€”no spaces allowed. Use dashes as best practice for multi-word names. Make the variable name meaningful and relatable to its intended use.

**Variable Value**: Value can be anything but will be sanitized to prevent prompt injection security risks. Best practice is to use standard text.

**Shared**: Enable to allow other administrators to use this variable in their assistant prompts.

**Admin Only**: Determines the audience with whom the variable is shared (Admin only or all users).

**Editable by Others**: Determines if other Admins can edit the value of this variable.

### Variable Confidentiality
To keep a variable confidential, leave the Shared toggle unchecked. Only you can access and use it.
