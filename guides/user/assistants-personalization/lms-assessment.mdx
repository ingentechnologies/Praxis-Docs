When configured by your institution, I can help you search for content on your LMS (Learning Management System such as Canvas, Praxis LXP, etc.). To do so, you will need to ask a question like

```
What are the assignments for my course?
```

Click the Connect to Canvas link to establish the connection with your LMS.

In the screen above, click Authorize to grant Pria access to your LMS. The screen will display the following success message:

Simply close the browser Tab to return to Pria and ask the question again:

## Conversational Assessment

As an AI Designed specifically for Education, I am equipped to offer Conversational Assessment whenever you want, and on any topic of your choice. It’s a great way to check your understanding of a topic in a “no judgement” zone. Let me be your study partner!

For the conversational assessment the topic of interests are prioritized based on

The Classroom material
Your file content
Recent Interactions,
Popular Educational and trending topics on the internet
The Conversational Assessment is a unique interactive experience designed to evaluate your knowledge and engagement on a specific topic of interest. Here’s how it works:

Topic Selection: It starts with choosing a topic you’re interested in. This could be anything from a technical skill, a subject related to positive psychology, to trendy topics on the internet. The choice is yours!
Question Series: Once a topic is selected, I’ll ask you a series of five diverse questions related to that topic. These questions are crafted to cover a broad spectrum of the chosen subject, aiming to assess your understanding, thoroughness, and focus.
Scoring: Each response you provide is scored based on three criteria:
Understanding: How well do you grasp the topic? (0-10 points)
Thoroughness: How detailed and comprehensive is your answer? (0-10 points)
Focus: How relevant and focused is your response to the question asked? (0-10 points) Your answers contribute to a maximum total of 150 points (5 questions x 30 points each).
Feedback: After each question, I’ll provide a score breakdown for your response, offering insights into areas of strength and opportunities for further learning.
Post-Assessment Summary: At the end of the assessment, you’ll receive a total score and an average grade percentage. Based on your performance, I’ll also recommend resources for further exploration on topics where you might want to deepen your knowledge.
Memory: If you choose, your scores and insights from the assessment can be saved for future reference, helping you track your learning progress over time.
The Conversational Assessment is a great way to challenge yourself, learn more about a subject, and identify areas for growth. It’s designed to be fun, informative, engaging, and a stepping stone for further exploration and learning.

To get started ask:

```
Let’s start a conversational assessment!

As you can see the topic listed have been prioritized based on the list above.Let’s choose “Responsible AI:”

Responsible AI

The interview is now going through the series of 5 questions. Let’s answer the first one. Enter:

In today’s technology landscape, where the world is opening its door to AI technologies, it is more important than ever to limit the risk of abuse or misuse of that technology, including but not limited to leaking and exchanging personal data without user consent.

I have evaluated your answer based on the grading rubric and prompted you to answer the next question. The assessment will continue until you answer the last question.

Questions answered with irrelevant responses or I don’t know will be treated as 0 point.

This is an example of the final answer.
