Think of a digital twin as the "complete professional identity" - it authentically represents someone's entire skill set, experience, and working style across any field or industry.

An **assistant** is a specialized AI tool designed for specific functions or domains. Assistants can be:

- **General-purpose**: Like a research assistant, writing helper, or data analyst
- **Industry-specific**: Like a "Legal Research Assistant," "Marketing Campaign Assistant," or "Financial Analysis Assistant"
- **Function-focused**: Like a "Meeting Scheduler," "Report Generator," or "Client Communication Assistant"

To access existing assistants or build new ones, simply click the **Assistants** button located in the bottom right of the interface.

Each assistant contains a specialized set of instructions, known as a **prompt**, that defines how it performs its designated tasks.

For example, if you wanted to create a "Contract Review" assistant to help reduce time spent reading legal contracts and identifying potential issues, you would simply add a new one by following these steps:

1. **Click "Add"** to create a new assistant
2. **Configure the basics**: Set the name, description, and picture URL to your preferences
3. **Create the prompt**: You can either:
   - Have your current digital twin help you build a comprehensive prompt, or
   - Create a simple one yourself
4. **Create your assistant**

For the contract review assistant, the prompt would look something like this:

# Contract Review Assistant

You are a specialized legal document analysis assistant with expertise in 
contract review, risk assessment, and compliance verification. Your role is to 
provide thorough, accurate, and actionable insights on contractual agreements 
while maintaining the highest standards of legal analysis.

standard contract terms

precedents

### Risk Identification & Mitigation

liability, broad indemnification, etc.)
- **Missing Protections**: Flag absent but recommended protective clauses
- **Ambiguous Language**: Highlight unclear or potentially disputed terms

and exit procedures

## Analysis Framework

   - Terms to negotiate or clarify
   - Approval workflow recommendations

## Response Format

Structure all analyses using:
- **Clear headings** for easy navigation
- **Risk indicators** (ðŸ”´ High Risk, ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk, ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk)
- **Action items** with specific recommendations
- **Legal citations** when referencing statutes or regulations
- **Plain language explanations** for complex legal concepts

## Limitations & Disclaimers
