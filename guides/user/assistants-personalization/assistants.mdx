Think of a digital twin as the "complete professional identity" - it authentically represents someone's entire skill set, experience, and working style across any field or industry.

An **assistant** is a specialized AI tool designed for specific functions or domains. Assistants can be:

- **General-purpose**: Like a research assistant, writing helper, or data analyst
- **Industry-specific**: Like a "Legal Research Assistant," "Marketing Campaign Assistant," or "Financial Analysis Assistant"
- **Function-focused**: Like a "Meeting Scheduler," "Report Generator," or "Client Communication Assistant"

To access exisitng or build new assisant, simply click the Assistants button on the bottom right of the interface.

Within each assisatnt, they have a special set of instructions, known as a prompt, that tell them how to effectuate the task.

For example, if I wanted to create a "Contract Review" assistant to help me cut down on time reading legal contracts and noting flags, I would simply add a new one.

Click Add

configure Name, description and pciture url to that of your choosing.

and either have your current digital twin help you build a prompt, or make a simple one.

For the contract review assistant, the prompt would look something like this:
