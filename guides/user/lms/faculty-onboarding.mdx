## Getting Started

When your Canvas administrator places a generic digital twin in your course, you have two options:

1. **Create a new digital twin instance** - Start fresh with course-specific customization
2. **Reuse an existing digital twin instance** - Connect to a previously created digital twin that has been associated with your email

## Creating a Digital Twin

### Initial Setup Process

When you first access your digital twin through your LMS, you'll be welcomed by the Digital Twin wizard that guides you through the creation process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Digital Twin">
    Navigate to your course in your Learning Management System (LMS) and click on the digital twin icon, typically located in the bottom-right corner of your course page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the Creation Wizard">
    Click the **\+ Digital Twin** button to create a personalized instance of your AI assistant.

    <Info>
      Digital Experts and Digital Twins use identical creation workflows but fulfill distinct roles. Digital Twins are personalized AI assistants that mirror your individual expertise, knowledge base, and teaching methodology, while Digital Experts offer specialized domain knowledge without personal customization. The key differentiator is the personalization prompt you provide during setupâ€”this determines whether the AI reflects your unique perspective or maintains a more generalized expert persona.

      style={{ width:"77%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Your Digital Twin">
    In the New Digital Twin dialog, enter:

    - **Name**: Choose a name for your twin (e.g., "Professor Smith's Assistant")
    - **Picture URL**: Provide a publicly accessible image URL (without CORS issues)
    - **Animated Picture URL (GIF)**: Provide a publicly accessible animated GIF URL that will serve as your digital twin's animated avatar (without CORS issues)
    - **UI Background URL**: Select a background image for the user interface
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Setup">
    Click **Let's GO\!** to finish creating your new digital twin instance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  For detailed information on AI personalization and prompting, refer to the [Personalization Guide](https://docs.praxis-ai.com/guides/admin/personalization).
</Note>

<Warning>
  Once you select an existing instance for a course, this association cannot be changed unless you first unlink the digital twin from that course.
</Warning>

## Unlinking a Digital Twin

### When to Unlink

You may need to unlink your digital twin from a course if you want to:

- Associate a different digital twin instance with the course
- Create a completely new digital twin for that course
- Remove the digital twin entirely

### Unlinking Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Profile">
    Navigate to your digital twin interface and go to your **Profile** page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate LTI Section">
    Scroll down to find the **LTI** section in your profile settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unlink Instance">
    Click the **Unlink from Current Instance** button to disconnect the digital twin from the current course.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Action">
    Confirm the unlinking action when prompted. This will remove the association between your digital twin and the current course.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  After unlinking, you'll need to go through the setup process again the next time you access the digital twin in that course.
</Note>
