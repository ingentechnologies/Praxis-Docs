## Image Analysis

Using GPT Vision model, I can analyze an image and provide a detailed description of what the image contains, the color pallet, recognize characters or plants, extract text similar to an OCR process.

Assume you need to analyze an image on the internet at URL https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/7/7e/Saylor_marking_example.jpg

This is the picture at the URL


Then just simply ask me:

```text Prompt wrap icon="comment" 
Can you analyze the picture at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/7/7e/Saylor_marking_example.jpg ?
```

I can analyze the file and provide a summary of its content! But this is not the extent of my capabilities.

Let’s try this:

```text Prompt wrap icon="comment"
What is the text in the picture at URL https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/7/7e/Saylor_marking_example.jpg ?
```

Here is my answer:
```text Response wrap icon="message-bot" 
```

This text extraction method can save you hours so you don’t have to retype the text on the text!

If you want to have some fun, upload a photo with a flower and ask me what plant is in the photo. Or make me guess which city, or country is shown in an uploaded photo.

## Extracting Text from Audio and Videos

If you have an audio or video recording, I can extract the audio as text. I can do this when importing an audio and video file.

Simply import a video file or by URL at https://ia802900.us.archive.org/1/items/youtube-3-xhMXeYIcg/3-xhMXeYIcg.mp4



- Click on your files link in the Input Text box
- In the File List, click the +Add button
- Select URL and enter the video location in the URL section below
- Click Upload
- See that checkmark and “Success” The video has been successfully uploaded and audio extracted as text transcripts.

When the process completes, click OK to close and view the file in your File List
The file has been imported. If you click on the Cube Icon, you will see the Audio Transcripts.
Click OK to close the Search Vectors, and OK to close the file list.

The video import is displayed in the Conversation History and is now included in your conversation


Now, you may ask questions about content from the audio transcripts. 

Ask me:

```text Prompt wrap icon="comment" 
What are the seven AI principles announced and on what day?
```

```text Response wrap icon="message-bot" 
```

## Youtube Transcripts

To transcribe a Youtube video, simply ask


transcribe the video at https://youtu.be/phWxA89Dy94?si=jlJ8ArBucQ1UQeen
Please note that it is best to use the Shared link (a.k.a. youtu.be/…. URL )


Additionally, you can save the transcription into your files for further analysis. Simply ask:

```text Prompt wrap icon="comment" 
Transcribe and save the video at https://youtu.be/phWxA89Dy94?si=jlJ8ArBucQ1UQeen
```

The transcription has now been saved into your file list:


Here are the embeddings extracted:


You can ask any questions to summarize the transcripts:

```text Prompt wrap icon="comment" 
Summarize the transcripts for ytb-tscripts_1721805757_phWxA89Dy94.txt
```

Here is a useful example of a compound query for a Youtube Video

```text Prompt wrap icon="comment" 
Find the location talking about “invisible axes” in the phWxA89Dy94 video and play it
```

## Play Videos on Youtube

You can ask Pria to directly play a video on Youtube, by using the Embed URL of the video like this:

Play the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phWxA89Dy94 at 19 seconds
Pria will identify the Embed URL of the video and add the player directly in its response like below:

## Play Audio and Video Files

You can play Audio and Videos when the file URLs are known. For example, if you upload an audio and a video file like below


Then you can simply ask:

```text Prompt wrap icon="comment" 
Play my audio file
```

Play my video
