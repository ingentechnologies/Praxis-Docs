One of my fortes is to help spur your creativity. I can write an essay on any topic of your choice. For example, ask me to:

```text Prompt wrap icon="comment"
Write an essay on the benefits and drawbacks of super markets, in a language that a 10 year old can understand, with no more than 3 sentences per paragraphs.
```

```text Response wrap icon="message-bot" 
The Benefits and Drawbacks of Supermarkets

Supermarkets are big stores where people can buy many different things, like food, drinks, and household items. One of the biggest benefits of supermarkets is that they have a wide variety of products all in one place. This makes shopping easier because you can find everything you need without going to many different stores.

Another benefit is that supermarkets often have lower prices than smaller stores. They can sell things for less money because they buy in large amounts and can pass those savings on to customers. This helps families save money when they go grocery shopping.

However, there are some drawbacks to supermarkets too. One problem is that they can be very big and crowded, which might make shopping feel overwhelming. Sometimes, people might feel lost or stressed when trying to find what they need in such a large space.

Another drawback is that small local shops can struggle to compete with supermarkets. When people choose to shop at big stores, it can hurt the smaller businesses in the community.
