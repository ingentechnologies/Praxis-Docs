One of my fortes is to help spur your creativity. I can write an essay on any topic of your choice. For example, ask me to:

Write an essay on the benefits and drawbacks of super markets, in a language that a 10 year old can understand, with no more than 3 sentences per paragraphs.

Not bad! Please note that in your question, you can specify a target audience, a tone (with humor, professional, etc.) and any guidelines, as to length, nature of the content, etc. The more detailed and specific, the better the outcome.

## Resource Locator (Links and Videos)

To create a complete essay it would be helpful to find some articles like websites or videos about the benefits and drawback of supermarkets, and include them when citing our sources.

I am equipped with several super-tools like SERP API, Google Search, Youtube Search, and can search anything online; like Scholarly articles, patents, and offline; in your documents.

Go ahead and ask me:

On the topic of the benefits and drawbacks of supermarkets, find me 3 pages URLs and 2 videos that illustrate the points explained in your previous answer


Yes, I remember our previous interactions so that your questions can build on each other!

## Finding Images

I can find images for you by looking up free pictures from Unsplash.org. Simply ask

Find 3 pictures of an oak tree

Using the Wolphram Alpha tool, I can render visual representations of text like so:

Display the music note: C

## Content Summarization

Additionally, you can summarize content from the internet, when the URL is known. Ask me:

Summarize the content at url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket


Content summarization is one of the pillars of AI.

Content Download

I have the power to download the textual content of a document when the URL is known, and the content is not copyrighted and protected.

Download the content at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-017-0078-6

Donâ€™t worry, this is a scholarly article with free access.


To look at the downloaded content, simply right click on the download link and open content in a new tab


You can take a look at what was extracted from the website:


If this content looks good and you would like to add it to your file collection for future use, the add it to your files.

I also have the ability to save content as a text file. For example:

write me a story about a mermaid and save it as a text file

Now when you got your files, the content will be saved as a text file:
