When the payment is completed, your instance will be credited with the number of credits you purchased. Your students can now use these credits when interacting with Pria 

If you do not want to purchase credits, BUT require your students to purchase credits for their own use, you must change your instance to disable the Pool Credits options. 

From the Pria screen, click on the Admin button.



The Admin interface is where you manage all of your instances. To customize an instance, click the green pencil Edit button 


The Edit Instance screen opens in the General Tab where you will find the Pool Credits option. Disable this option to require students to use their own credits to interact with Pria 


To use only when Pool Credits is disabled: The Credits Awarded to Users will grant the given amount of credits - debited from your instance – to the user on first registration. When the user runs out of credits, and the Pool Credits option is disabled, users will be required to purchase credits if they want to continue interacting with Pria.
