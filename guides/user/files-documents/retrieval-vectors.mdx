In the file list, click on the Cube Icon, to display the Search Vectors for the selected file. These chunks contain textual elements that were ingested when the file was uploaded. I search these elements when you ask a questions using a technology call Vector Searching with the Euclidean Nearest Neighbor algorithm. It’s a little bit like the Amazon recommendations: People that buy this also buy that.

When I find relevant pieces of information from your documents, I add them to our conversation. This is a process called Retrieval Augmentation Generation (or RAG)

Click OK to close this page and return to the file list

Click the +Add button to upload additional files to the list, or for now, click OK to close the file list.


Any files you upload will appear in your conversation history, because they used credits to generate embeddings for vector search capability.


The number of files included in the conversation is displayed on the top portion of the Input text.


Did you know that you can list and address your files directly? You can ask me anything about your files, for example:

What are my files?

Files can contain text, but can also be images. In fact I am even capable of recognizing text or elements inside a picture!
