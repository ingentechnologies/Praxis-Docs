## Upload Files

You can add files to a collection so that I can search and include relevant elements in my answers. To access your file list, click on “Add” and the paperclip icon.

The first time around, you will be prompted to Add a file

You can select a file from your device, or simply point to a URL to download the text content at that specific location.
I support a large variety of file types, including (but not limited to )
