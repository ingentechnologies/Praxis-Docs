## Overview of My Capabilities
I'm designed to assist you with a variety of tasks and inquiries, leveraging advanced AI technologies. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what I can do for you:



### Answer Questions
I can provide detailed explanations on a vast array of subjects including science, technology, history, culture, and much more.


**For example, you can ask me:**
```text wrap
- "What are the principles of quantum mechanics?"
- "Can you explain the significance of the Renaissance period?"
```



### Research Assistance
Utilizing tools like Wolfram Alpha for data visualization and analysis, I can help with computational tasks, scientific equations, and provide insights on geographic, economic, and other data-driven queries.

**For example, you can ask me:**
```text wrap
- "What is the population density of New York City?"
- "Can you help me analyze this dataset?"
```


### Educational Support
I can search for scholarly articles, patents, and clinical trials, offering a deeper dive into academic and scientific research. I'm even connected to your LMS such as Canvas to help you search for information.

**For example, you can ask me:**
```text wrap
- "Find me a research paper on climate change."
- "What are the latest developments in AI research?"
```

### Creative Assistance
Whether it's generating images based on detailed descriptions or analyzing images for content, context, and significance, I'm here to boost your creativity.

**For example, you can ask me:**
```text wrap
- "Create an image of a futuristic cityscape."
- "Analyze this image and tell me what you see."
```

### Practical Tasks
From browsing the internet for the latest information to providing maps and directions, I can assist with everyday tasks and inquiries.

**For example, you can ask me:**
```text wrap
- "What's the weather like today?"
- "Can you help me find a restaurant nearby?"
``` 

### Entertainment and Learning
I can find videos on a wide range of topics for both education and entertainment. I can even transcribe videos on Youtube, search for specific segments and play them for you.

**For example, you can ask me:**
```text wrap
- "Find me a documentary on climate change."
- "Can you summarize this educational video?"
```

### Personalized Interaction
I remember our conversations and can recall saved results or preferences to tailor our interactions to your interests.

**For example, you can ask me:**
```text wrap
- "What did we discuss last time?"
- "Can you save this information for future reference?"
```

### Conversational Assessments
Engage in conversational assessments on topics of your choice to test knowledge, with personalized feedback and resources for further learning.

**For example, you can ask me:**
```text wrap
- "Can we do a quiz on world history?"
- "I want to test my knowledge on biology."
```


### Accessibility Support
I aim to make information accessible, providing text descriptions for visual content to ensure users with different abilities can enjoy the content.

**For example, you can ask me:**
```text wrap
- "Describe this image for me."
- "Can you provide a text description of this video?"
```

### Continuous Learning
I'm designed to learn from our interactions in order to provide more relevant and personalized responses as we go.

**For example, you can ask me:**
```text wrap
- "How can I improve my learning experience?"
- "What topics do I seem interested in?"
```

### Knowledge Base Vector Search
I use vector search algorithms to find elements of knowledge in the files you supply and augment my capacity to generate accurate and pertinent responses.
In short, my technology combines Prompt Engineering, AI Agents, and Vector Search capabilities to offer the most cutting-edge assistant for your educational needs. I am embedded in your learning management system, like Canvas, so I am aware of the instructional content of your courses.

**For example, you can ask me:**
```text wrap
- "Search my course materials for information on photosynthesis."
- "Find relevant articles in my library about machine learning."
- "Can you help me with my homework on algebra?"
```
