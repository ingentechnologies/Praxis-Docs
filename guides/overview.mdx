## Make it yours

Since LLM (Large Language Models like me) accepts prompts in **Natural Language**, we tend to get more accurate and precise answers if we provide more descriptive prompts. It is similar to providing more details in an address to reach the desired location more accurately.

Now the question arises, **how to formulate the `prompt` to get more accurate and precise answers?** Here are some great prompts for software developers:

For example, you can save information to memory:

```
> Save the following properties in the namespace `granola`:  
> I eat cereals every morning with coffee, then I go to the gym and drink a protein shake that keeps me going for the day. At night, I try to eat salad and avoid sugar altogether so I can go to bed hungry. I hope that this diet will help me lose 5 pounds in 2 weeks.
```


To recall parameters from a specific namespace, simply ask me:

 ``` 
 What do you remember about granola? 
 ```

Now the question arises, **how to formulate the `prompt` to get more accurate and precise answers?** Here are some great prompts for software developers:

```
Explain how the {concept or function} works in {programming language}.**
```

```
What is the correct syntax for a {statement or function} in {programming language}?
```

```
How do I fix the following {programming language} code which {explain the functioning}? {code snippet}
```

```
Show me best practices for writing {concept or function} in {programming language}.
```

```
Optimize the following {programming language} code which {explain the functioning}: {code snippet}
```

```
Write a program/function to {explain functionality} in {programming language}**
```

```
I want you to act like a {programming language} interpreter/compiler. I will give you {programming language} code, and you will execute it. Do not provide any explanations. Do not respond with anything except the output of the code. The first code is: {code}**
```

```
Convert the following {programming language 1} code to {programming language 2}: {code snippet}
```

```
I want you to act as a web design consultant. I will provide you with details related to an organization needing assistance in designing or redeveloping its website, and your role is to suggest the most suitable interface and features that can enhance user experience while also meeting the company's business goals. You should use your knowledge of UX/UI design principles, coding languages, website development tools, etc, in order to develop a comprehensive plan for the project. My first request is "I need help creating a {website type} for {purpose}."
```

```
Regenerate the code snippet below, but please include comments on each line of code {enter code}
```

```
Generate documentation for the code below. You should include detailed instructions to allow a developer to run it on a local machine, explain what the code does, and list vulnerabilities that exist in this code. {enter code}
```

```
Can you help me write test cases for this feature {explain the feature}?

The recorder detects that your question is finished after a long silence, and will submit your text input to me.

To listen to my answer, click on the ‚ÄúSpeak‚Äù button at the bottom of my response:

History, Left Nav Bar, Favorites and Settings
---------------------------------------------

### Conversation History

Each dialogue containing your question and my answer is recorded and added into the conversation history. The conversation history has several useful buttons to help you navigate the history as well as adding or removing some dialogues to/from your list of favorites.

The following functions are available:

1. Open the side tab to navigate your conversations  
2. Make your conversation appear larger or smaller  
3. Click the star to add the conversation to your favorites

Marking a dialogue as a Favorite allows you to quickly go back to it when you need.

**Conversations** help you organize your interactions with Pria. Each time you start a new chat through assistants or switch between Canvas classes using the same digital twin, a new conversation is created. You can rename, sort by date, or clear these conversations as needed.

**Favorites** allow you to bookmark and easily access important responses. When you click the star icon on any response, it's saved to your Favorites list for quick reference later. Clicking on a favorite will help you jump directly to it.

**Settings** allow you to customize your Pria experience by adjusting three key options: the AI Conversation Model, the maximum number of dialogues displayed, and the remember history for Pria.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Max Dialogues: | Determine the maximum number of dialog to load in your history pane. Too many dialogs may impact performance of the UI, while not enough limit the number of dialogs you can scroll back to. Use 25 by default. |
| Remember History: | This setting determines the number of dialogues I can remember in each conversation, allowing me to recall your previous questions and answers. This is particularly important during interactions that require analyzing your past responses, such as the Conversational Assessment or Interview process.<p>A minimum value of 6 is required for the Conversational Assessment. While this setting enhances the context of each interaction, it may also consume additional credits. Therefore, we recommend keeping it between 3 and 6 as needed.</p> |

### Listing Conversations

The conversations list displays the various interactions you've had with this Pria instance.

For example, a new conversation will be created when you initiate a fresh conversation with your conversational assessment assistant or switch between courses in Canvas that utilize the same Pria instance.

You can see which conversation you are in by looking at the top of the Pria dialogue.

The conversation list shows the name of the Course or Assistant used, the date it was created and how many dialogues this conversation has. You can manage any conversation like below:

You can rename a conversation or delete it entirely if you are no longer using it.

Note about Delete: Beware, this will delete this conversation history so only clear if you are Okay no longer referencing these dialogues.

Now let's look at a few of my capabilities, and remember the sky is the limit!

Content Creation
----------------

### Image Generation

The more detailed your questions, the better! Ask me to

```
Generate a detailed, high resolution and 3D image of the human DNA with shiny accents and vivid colors
```

Stunning picture indeed! I am using DALL-E to generate this high resolution image. It is saved in your home folder. You can right click and save it on your device this way, or use the dialog options to share a link to your friends.

```
_Take a look at my response:_

> Certainly! I'd be happy to generate a detailed, high-resolution 3D image of human DNA with shiny accents and vivid colors for you. I'll use the image generation tool to create this visualization. Let me do that for you now. I've generated a detailed, high-resolution 3D image of human DNA with shiny accents and vivid colors as you requested. Here's a description of the image I've created for you:
> 
> The image showcases a striking 3D representation of the human DNA double helix structure. The DNA strands are prominently featured, with each strand clearly visible and intricately detailed. The base pairs are depicted in vivid, bright colors, including deep blues, vibrant reds, rich greens, and bright yellows, making the structure visually appealing and easy to distinguish.
> 
> The phosphate-sugar backbone of the DNA has been given a shiny, metallic accent, which adds a sleek and modern appearance to the classic biological structure. This metallic sheen catches the light, creating an eye-catching contrast with the colorful base pairs.
> 
> To make the DNA structure truly pop, the background is rendered as a dark, deep space-like setting. This stark contrast helps to emphasize the intricate details of the DNA molecule. Adding depth and a sense of movement to the image, there are soft, glowing particles floating around the DNA, giving the impression that the molecule is suspended in a dynamic environment.
> 
> The overall image has a high-resolution, photorealistic quality with sharp details and smooth gradients, allowing you to see the fine structures of the DNA clearly. The combination of the vivid colors, shiny accents, and the space-like background creates a visually stunning and scientifically accurate representation of human DNA.
> 
> This image could be perfect for educational purposes, scientific presentations, or as a striking visual element in any context where you want to showcase the beauty and complexity of human genetics.
```

Note that for every image I generate, I also give you a detail sentence explaining the design choices I made to generate the picture. You could copy this text, and use it to reformulate a new question, with more details and guided instructions.

### Sharing A Dialogue

To share a dialogue, simply get the link from the context menu by clicking on the green link like below

The link (content) is copied onto the clipboard.

Then share it with your peers. This is what a link looks like:

[https://pria.praxislxp.com/views/history/6618bc1f1d7543182e9b3133](https://pria.praxislxp.com/views/history/6618bc1f1d7543182e9b3133)

You can share this with anyone whether or not they're registered on or logged-in to Pria.

You can also view the dialogue by clicking on the orange eye icon from the context menu

In this view, you can also copy and share the secure link to such dialogue.

### Content Generation

One of my fortes is to help spur your creativity. I can write an essay on any topic of your choice. For example, ask me to:

```
> Write an essay on the benefits and drawbacks of super markets, in a language that a 10 year old can understand, with no more than 3 sentences per paragraphs.
```

Not bad! Please note that in your question, you can specify a target audience, a tone (with humor, professional, etc.) and any guidelines, as to length, nature of the content, etc. The more detailed and specific, the better the outcome.

### Resource Locator (Links and Videos)

To create a complete essay it would be helpful to find some articles like websites or videos about the benefits and drawback of supermarkets, and include them when citing our sources.

I am equipped with several super-tools like SERP API, Google Search, Youtube Search, and can search anything online; like Scholarly articles, patents, and offline; in your documents.

Go ahead and ask me:

```
On the topic of the benefits and drawbacks of supermarkets, find me 3 pages URLs and 2 videos that illustrate the points explained in your previous answer
```

Yes, I remember our previous interactions so that your questions can build on each other!

### Finding Images

I can find images for you by looking up free pictures from Unsplash.org. Simply ask

```
Find 3 pictures of an oak tree
```

Using the Wolphram Alpha tool, I can render visual representations of text like so:

```
Display the music note: C
```

### Content Summarization

Additionally, you can summarize content from the internet, when the URL is known. Ask me:

> Summarize the content at url [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket)

Content summarization is one of the pillars of AI.

### Content Download

I have the power to download the textual content of a document when the URL is known, and the content is not copyrighted and protected.

> Download the content at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-017-0078-6

Don't worry, this is a scholarly article with free access.

To look at the downloaded content, simply right click on the download link and open content in a new tab

You can take a look at what was extracted from the website:

If this content looks good and you would like to add it to your file collection for future use, the add it to your files.

I also have the ability to save content as a text file. For example:

> write me a story about a mermaid and save it as a text file

Now when you got your files, the content will be saved as a text file:

Assistants

Files Management
----------------

### Upload Files

You can add files to a collection so that I can search and include relevant elements in my answers. To access your file list, click on ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù and the paperclip icon.

The first time around, you will be prompted to Add a file

You can select a file from your device, or simply point to a URL to download the text content at that specific location.

I support a large variety of file types, including (but not limited to )

| Category | File Types |
|----------|------------|
| Images | PNG, WEBP, JPEG, JPG |
| Audio | M4A, MP3, M4A, WAV, WEBM |

| IMS Creative Common format | IMSCC |
| ZIP | ZIP |

Click Upload File (1) or URL, then select a File (2). Use your device file manager to select an input file (in this example a docx), then click Ok in the lower-left corner.

The file is now added to the list of files to upload. Repeat adding as files as needed up to 500MB.

Click Upload (3) to start the upload process. A progress indicator will display in green below. After the files are uploaded, the process of ingestion starts and can take several minutes to complete.

When the ingestion process completes, the file status is ‚ÄúSuccess.‚Äù

Click Done to return to the file list.

### Upload Pages (URL)

PRia s equipped with the ability to scrape a web page and a given URL, extract the text and download it into your files list.

In the File Upload, click on the URL tab, then enter the URL of the web page, example:

> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

Click Upload

Click OK to close the upload dialog, you have imported the entire content of the page at the URL

### My Files

This is what the file list would look like when several files have been uploaded.

In this File List,

Click the Included button to include a file in your conversation with me.

When the include button is not blue, the file will be excluded from the conversation with me.

Click the Confidential button to not allow me to cite this file as a source.

When the confidential button not blue, this allows me to cite this file as a source.

Use the Cube Icon to review the content from the file that has been ingested

Use the Download Icon to download the file onto your device

Use the delete icon to remove the file completely. This option is available only when the file is excluded from the conversation with me.

Enter a file name in the search text box to locate a file by name

Click the Refresh Icon to reload the file list, when you think the ingestion process may have completed asynchronously, or simply to reload the most recent listing.

### RAG: Search Vectors

In the file list, click on the Cube Icon, to display the Search Vectors for the selected file. These chunks contain textual elements that were ingested when the file was uploaded. I search these elements when you ask a questions using a technology call Vector Searching with the Euclidean Nearest Neighbor algorithm. It's a little bit like the Amazon recommendations: People that buy this also buy that.

When I find relevant pieces of information from your documents, I add them to our conversation. This is a process called Retrieval Augmentation Generation (or RAG)

Click OK to close this page and return to the file list

Click the +Add button to upload additional files to the list, or for now, click OK to close the file list.

Any files you upload will appear in your conversation history, because they used credits to generate embeddings for vector search capability.

The number of files included in the conversation is displayed on the top portion of the Input text.

Did you know that you can list and address your files directly? You can ask me anything about your files, for example:

> What are my files?

Files can contain text, but can also be images. In fact I am even capable of recognizing text or elements inside a picture!

### Image Analysis

Using GPT Vision model, I can analyze an image and provide a detailed description of what the image contains, the color pallet, recognize characters or plants, extract text similar to an OCR process.

Assume you need to analyze an image on the internet at URL [https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/7/7e/Saylor\_marking\_example.jpg](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/7/7e/Saylor_marking_example.jpg)

This is the picture at the URL

Then just simply ask me:

> Can you analyze the picture at [https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/7/7e/Saylor\_marking\_example.jpg](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/7/7e/Saylor_marking_example.jpg) ?

I can analyze the file and provide a summary of its content! But this is not the extent of my capabilities. Let's try this:

> What is the text in the picture at URL [https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/7/7e/Saylor\_marking\_example.jpg](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/7/7e/Saylor_marking_example.jpg) ?

Here is my answer:

This text extraction method can save you hours so you don't have to retype the text on the text!

If you want to have some fun, upload a photo with a flower and ask me what plant is in the photo. Or make me guess which city, or country is shown in an uploaded photo.

### Extracting Text from Audio and Videos

If you have an audio or video recording, I can extract the audio as text. I can do this when importing an audio and video file.

Simply import a video file or by URL at [https://ia802900.us.archive.org/1/items/youtube-3-xhMXeYIcg/3-xhMXeYIcg.mp4](https://ia802900.us.archive.org/1/items/youtube-3-xhMXeYIcg/3-xhMXeYIcg.mp4)

Click on your files link in the Input Text box

In the File List, click the +Add button

Select URL and enter the video location in the URL section below

Click Upload

See that checkmark and ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù The video has been successfully uploaded and audio extracted as text transcripts.

When the process completes, click OK to close and view the file in your File List

The file has been imported. If you click on the Cube Icon, you will see the Audio Transcripts.

Click OK to close the Search Vectors, and OK to close the file list.

The video import is displayed in the Conversation History and is now included in your conversation

Now, you may ask questions about content from the audio transcripts. Ask me:

> What are the seven AI principles announced and on what day?

### Youtube Transcripts

To transcribe a Youtube video, simply ask

>   
> transcribe the video at [https://youtu.be/phWxA89Dy94?si=jlJ8ArBucQ1UQeen](https://youtu.be/phWxA89Dy94?si=jlJ8ArBucQ1UQeen)

Please note that it is best to use the Shared link (a.k.a. youtu.be/‚Ä¶. URL )

Additionally, you can **save** the transcription into your files for further analysis. Simply ask:

> Transcribe and **save** the video at https://youtu.be/phWxA89Dy94?si=jlJ8ArBucQ1UQeen

The transcription has now been saved into your file list:

Here are the embeddings extracted:

You can ask any questions to summarize the transcripts:

> Summarize the transcripts for ytb-tscripts\_1721805757\_phWxA89Dy94.txt

Here is a useful example of a compound query for a Youtube Video

> Find the location talking about ‚Äúinvisible axes‚Äù in the phWxA89Dy94 video and play it

### Play Videos on Youtube

You can ask Pria to directly play a video on Youtube, by using the Embed URL of the video like this:

> Play the video at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phWxA89Dy94](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phWxA89Dy94)¬†at 19 seconds

Pria will identify the Embed URL of the video and add the player directly in its response like below:

### Play Audio and Video Files

You can play Audio and Videos when the file URLs are known. For example, if you upload an audio and a video file like below

Then you can simply ask:

> Play my audio file

> Play my video

### Finding Sounds

I can find sounds by searching the **FreeSound.org** database. Simply ask:

> Find 3 sounds of the tropical rain

Technical Assistance
--------------------

### Writing Code

I can help you write code in almost any programming language. For example, ask me:

> Write react code to call the google API

### BLAST Feature

This feature uses a powerful bioinformatics tool used to compare a query sequence (DNA, RNA, or protein) against a database of sequences to identify regions of similarity.¬†

The tool offers various types of BLAST searches, including:

*   blastn: for nucleotide-nucleotide comparisons
*   blastp: for protein-protein comparisons
*   blastx: for nucleotide query against protein database
*   tblastn: for protein query against nucleotide database

For example:

> search blastp for MKVKVLSLLVPALLVAGAANAAEVYNKDGNKLDLYGKVDGLHYFSDNKDVDGDQTYMRLGFKGETQVTDQLTGYGQWEYQIQGNSAENENNSWTRVAFAGLKFQDVGSFDYGRNYGVVYDALGYTDMLPEFGGDTAYSDDFFVGRVGGVATYRNSNFFGLVDGLNFAVQYLGKNERDTARRSNGDGVGGSISYEYEGFGIVGAYGAADRTNLQEAQPLGNGKKAEQWATGLKYDANNIYLAANYGETRNATPITNKFTNTSGFANKTQDVLLVAQYQFDFGLRPSIAYTKSKAKDVEGIGDVDLVNYFEVGATYYFNKNMSTYVDYIINQIDSDNKLGVGSDDTVAVGIVYQF and save the result

### Generate SVG icons

Here is an example on how to create an icon, by simply describing its content and meaning

> Generate an SVG icon with view box ‚Äú0 0 24 24‚Äù that means expand and contract horizontally, using a chevron left, an outlined rectangle of the same height in the center and chevron right . Each symbols should be spaced out equally, have space between them and not overlap. Use stroke width of 1.

### Prompts for Software Developer

Since LLM (Large Language Models like me) accepts prompts in¬†**Natural Language**, we tend to get more accurate and precise answers if we provide more descriptive prompts. It is similar to providing more details in an address to reach the desired location more accurately.

Now the question arises,¬†**how to formulate the ‚Äòprompt' to get more accurate and precise answers?**¬†Here is a some great prompts for software Developers:

```
> _**Explain how the {concept or function} works in {programming language}.**_

> _**What is the correct syntax for a {statement or function} in {programming language}?**_

> _**How do I fix the following {programming language} code which {explain the functioning}? {code snippet}**_

> _**Show me best practices for writing {concept or function} in {programming language}.**_

### 2D Charting

I am equipped with a special tool that help visualize datasets in 2D.

The `create_chart_2d` tool allows me to turn numbers and data into easy-to-understand charts. Here's how it works in simple steps:

1.  **Get Data**: I take data from different formats like CSV or TSV, or even data you paste into my input dialog entry
2.  **Organize Data**: I sort the data so it's ready to be turned into a chart.
3.  **Make Charts**: Using [Apex Charts](https://apexcharts.com/) , I create visual charts, like lines or bars, to show what the data means.

This is an example at work:

```
Generate a chart for the following data set:  
2022 2023 2024 2025 2021\* 2022\* 2023\* 2024 2025  
I Q\* II Q\* III Q\* IV Q\* I Q\* II Q\* III Q\* IV Q\* I Q II Q III Q IV Q I Q II Q III Q IV Q  
Real GDP ‚àí2.0 ‚àí0.6 2.7 2.6 2.2 2.1 4.9 3.4 2.3 0.6 2.6 1.2 1.7 1.9 2.0 2.1 5.8 1.9 2.5 2.2 1.5  
Real GDP (YoY) 3.6 1.9 1.7 0.7 1.7 2.4 2.9 3.1 3.1 2.8 1.7 1.2 1.0 1.3 1.7 1.9 5.8 1.9 2.5 2.2 1.5
```


Click on the Type and select a different way to render the data, such as Bar Chart, Line hart, Area, Plot, Scatter, Heat Map, etc.

An another using the Area

Additional options are offered on the graph to allow extracting the data as CSV and zoom in/out on specific sections.

Whether you're analyzing financial trends, tracking website traffic, or comparing sales performance across different regions, this tool unlocks the full potential of your data through effective visualization.

Advanced Features

### LMS Integration

When configured by your institution, I can help you search for content on your LMS (Learning Management System such as Canvas, Praxis LXP, etc.). To do so, you will need to ask a question like

> What are the assignments for my course?

Click the Connect to Canvas link to establish the connection with your LMS.

In the screen above, click Authorize to grant Pria access to your LMS. The screen will display the following success message:

Simply close the browser Tab to return to Pria and ask the question again:

> What are the assignments for my course?

The response include links to your Canvas LMS to access specific details about your assignments.

As an example, here is the page following the link number 2. Statistical Method, directly linked onto the Praxis's instance of Canvas.

### Conversational Assessment

As an AI Designed specifically for Education, I am equipped to offer Conversational Assessment whenever you want, and on any topic of your choice. It's a great way to check your understanding of a topic in a ‚Äúno judgement‚Äù zone. Let me be your study partner!

For the conversational assessment the topic of interests are prioritized based on

*   The Classroom material
*   Your file content
*   Recent Interactions,
*   Popular Educational and trending topics on the internet

The Conversational Assessment is a unique interactive experience designed to evaluate your knowledge and engagement on a specific topic of interest. Here's how it works:

1.  **Topic Selection**: It starts with choosing a topic you're interested in. This could be anything from a technical skill, a subject related to positive psychology, to trendy topics on the internet. The choice is yours!
2.  **Question Series**: Once a topic is selected, I'll ask you a series of five diverse questions related to that topic. These questions are crafted to cover a broad spectrum of the chosen subject, aiming to assess your understanding, thoroughness, and focus.
3.  **Scoring**: Each response you provide is scored based on three criteria:

*   **Understanding**: How well do you grasp the topic? (0-10 points)
*   **Thoroughness**: How detailed and comprehensive is your answer? (0-10 points)
*   **Focus**: How relevant and focused is your response to the question asked? (0-10 points) Your answers contribute to a maximum total of 150 points (5 questions x 30 points each).

1.  **Feedback**: After each question, I'll provide a score breakdown for your response, offering insights into areas of strength and opportunities for further learning.
2.  **Post-Assessment Summary**: At the end of the assessment, you'll receive a total score and an average grade percentage. Based on your performance, I'll also recommend resources for further exploration on topics where you might want to deepen your knowledge.
3.  **Memory**: If you choose, your scores and insights from the assessment can be saved for future reference, helping you track your learning progress over time.

The Conversational Assessment is a great way to challenge yourself, learn more about a subject, and identify areas for growth. It's designed to be fun, informative, engaging, and a stepping stone for further exploration and learning.

To get started ask:

> Let's start a conversational assessment!

As you can see the topic listed have been prioritized based on the list above.Let's choose ‚ÄúResponsible AI:‚Äù

> Responsible AI

The interview is now going through the series of 5 questions. Let's answer the first one. Enter:

> In today's technology landscape, where the world is opening its door to AI technologies, it is more important than ever to limit the risk of abuse or misuse of that technology, including but not limited to leaking and exchanging personal data without user consent.

I have evaluated your answer based on the grading rubric and prompted you to answer the next question. The assessment will continue until you answer the last question.

Questions answered with irrelevant responses or I don't know will be treated as 0 point.

This is an example of the final answer.

### User Memory

The User Memory is a feature unique to me. Using this feature, you can save parameters into a long term memory that I can utilize in our conversation.

> Can you remember that my preferred programming language is JAVASCRIPT ? Use this parameter when I ask for questions on coding, APIs, or you give me some sample code, etc.

Use it to save the score earned with the assessment in the exercise above

The user memory is a feature that allows me to store, recall, and utilize specific pieces of information shared by you during our interactions. This capability is designed to personalize and enhance our conversation by remembering details that you've mentioned or preferences you've set. Here's how it can be used:

1.  **Personalization:** By remembering your preferences, such as your favorite foods (like peanut butter and milkshakes), I can tailor my responses to align more closely with your likes and interests.
2.  **Continuity:** It helps maintain continuity in our conversations. For instance, if you tell me about your daily routines or goals (like your diet goal to lose 5 pounds in 2 weeks), I can follow up on these topics in future interactions, creating a more coherent and engaging experience.
3.  **Efficiency:** It allows for more efficient interactions. By remembering key details, such as your morning and night routines, I can provide relevant suggestions or information without needing you to repeat yourself.
4.  **Customization:** The memory can be used to customize responses and advice based on the specific details you've shared, such as your routines or dietary preferences.
5.  **Contextual Awareness:** It gives me contextual awareness of your situation or background, enabling me to provide more accurate and helpful responses.

The user memory is structured in namespaces, allowing for organized storage and retrieval of information across different topics or categories. This structured approach ensures that the information is used appropriately and efficiently in our conversations.

Remember, you have control over what is stored in your memory, and you can update or remove information as you see fit, ensuring that our interactions remain relevant and respectful of your privacy preferences.

The user memory can be cleared completely and at anytime by simply asking me: Clear my user memory.

Here is an example that demonstrates how I can save multiple variables grouped into a namespace.

Enter:

> Save the following properties in the namespace ‚Äògranola':  
> I eat cereals every morning with coffee, then I go to the gym and drink a protein shake that keeps me going for the day. At night, I try to eat salad and avoid sugar altogether so I can go to bed hungry. I hope that this diet will help me lose 5 pounds in 2 weeks.

To recall parameters from a specific namespace, simply ask me:

> What do you remember about Granola

For advanced functions, you can ask

> Show my memory in JSON

> Can you print the content of my user memory in a table format ?

The memory feature can be used for many purposes. Some applications, including research in microbiology, financial calculator, use the user memory to define variables used and collected values throughout a conversation, then to compare variables across namespace to identify patterns and correlations, to advance the fight against cancer.

### Scientific Notations

I fully support scientific notations in KaTeX format. Here is an example of question a Math teacher asked:

> Evaluate the triple integral of f(x,y,z) = z, where z goes from 0 to sqrt(4-x^2-y^2), and y goes from -sqrt(4-x^2) to sqrt(4-x^2) and x goes from -2 to 2.

And an additional one in Chemistry

> If 20.86 mL of 2.29 M potassium iodide is needed to reach the equivalence point with 16.29 mL of lead (II) nitrate, determine the molarity of the lead (II) nitrate solution.  
> Note: First write the balance equation between potassium iodide and lead (II) nitrate.

### Putting it together

The power of AI lies in its ability to combine tasks into a complete agential workflow. Let's consider the following workflow below to create a complete essay on the Benefits and Drawbacks of Supermarkets:

> 1- Give me 5 items on the benefits and 5 items on the drawbacks of supermarkets
> 
> 2- Find 2 resources relevant to each of the 10 items previously listed
> 
> 3- For each of the 10 items, add a 1 paragraph explanation and explain how the resources are relevant
> 
> 4- Develop an introduction and conclusion paragraph and add it to the essay
> 
> 5- Generate a picture that demonstrates the methods of self service and stock management in supermarkets

Thank you for reading the getting started guide. I hope you have a wonderful journey of discovery with me in the world of Generative AI.
