1. Users create organizational accounts.
   Organizational accounts can have any number of AI instances that have a unique persona, style, voice, these are called Digital Experts.
   The Digital Experts have a main prompt that provide these characteristics.
   Each Digital Expert has their own isolated knowledge repository that is stored in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database that we call the IPVault.
   Each Digital Expert can have a unique set of tools that they can use to assist users.
   These tools can include web search, Wolfram Alpha, and other APIs.
2. Users can interact with the Digital Experts through a chat interface or voice commands.
3. Each Digital Expert can be customized with a unique set of instructions and capabilities.
4. Each instance can have any number of agents that we call assistants.
5. Each Digital Expert can choose their LLM model, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.
6. When communicating with the LLM's data is obfuscated and anonymized.



Summary:
This document outlines the architecture of a sophisticated AI platform designed for organizational use.
The system follows a hierarchical structure that begins with users creating organizational accounts, which serve as the top-level containers for all AI resources within a company or team.

The core concept revolves around Digital Experts - specialized AI instances that function as distinct virtual consultants within each organizational account.
Each Digital Expert is designed with a unique personality, communication style, and voice, making them feel like individual team members rather than generic chatbots.
These characteristics are defined through a main prompt that serves as the foundational instructions for how each Digital Expert should behave and respond.

A key feature of this architecture is the IPVault (Intellectual Property Vault), which provides each Digital Expert with its own isolated knowledge repository.
This uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, allowing each AI to access and reference specific, curated information relevant to its role while maintaining data separation between different experts.
This isolation ensures that sensitive or role-specific information remains compartmentalized.

The platform emphasizes flexibility and customization at multiple levels. Digital Experts can be equipped with various external tools including web search capabilities, Wolfram Alpha for computational queries, and other API integrations.
Users can interact with these AI assistants through both traditional chat interfaces and voice commands, providing multiple interaction modalities.

Each Digital Expert can also manage multiple subordinate agents called assistants, creating a scalable hierarchy of AI helpers.
The system supports model diversity by allowing each Digital Expert to utilize different Large Language Models (LLMs) from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, enabling organizations to match specific AI capabilities with particular use cases.

Privacy and security are built into the core architecture, with data obfuscation and anonymization occurring automatically when communicating with external LLM providers.
This ensures that sensitive organizational information remains protected while still leveraging powerful AI capabilities.
