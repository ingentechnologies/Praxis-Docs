  <Accordion title="What is a digital twin?">
    A digital twin is an AI-powered virtual assistant that learns and adapts to your specific needs, context, and goals. It understands your unique preferences, working style, and objectives to provide personalized support. Whether you're a student seeking customized tutoring, a teacher managing classroom activities, or a business professional handling complex projects, your digital twin continuously learns from interactions to become more effective over time. Each digital twin is unique, evolving to match your communication style and helping you achieve better outcomes in learning, productivity, and decision-making.

  <Accordion title="Is my data secure?">
    Yes, Praxis AI maintains enterprise-grade security with SOC 2 compliance and bank-level encryption. Your data is protected through end-to-end encryption for all transmission and storage, role-based access controls ensuring only authorized users can access specific information, and multi-tenant architecture with isolated environments for each organization. We maintain compliance with educational standards like FERPA and COPPA while providing comprehensive data governance tools for all users. Our IP Vault technology keeps your proprietary content secure while enabling AI training, and we conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to ensure your information remains protected.

  <Accordion title="What is middleware?">
    Middleware is the secure bridge that connects your existing systems with Praxis AI without compromising data security. It acts as a protective layer that integrates seamlessly with your current tools—whether that's learning management systems, business software, or databases—while maintaining data sovereignty by keeping sensitive information in your environment. Middleware enables real-time synchronization without exposing internal systems and provides audit trails for all data interactions. This allows you to leverage AI capabilities while working within your familiar ecosystem of tools and maintaining security boundaries.

  <Accordion title="Why should I enable location settings?">
    Location settings enhance your digital twin's contextual awareness and functionality by providing relevant, proximity-based information and resources. Location data also enables emergency features like safety notifications and emergency response coordination. Your location data is encrypted and used only to improve your experience with personalized recommendations for content, events, and resources. You can disable this feature at any time while maintaining full platform functionality.

  <Accordion title="How to add credits?">
    Credits power advanced AI features and extended usage. Individual users can purchase credits through the platform billing section with multiple payment options including credit card, ACH, and wire transfer, or choose subscription plans with included credit allowances. Organizations can manage credits through admin dashboards with automatic billing integration, institutional billing through purchase orders, and volume discounts for larger deployments. Enterprise agreements offer custom credit allocations with usage-based pricing and predictable monthly caps. Educational institutions may also access grant funding assistance to support their AI initiatives.

  <Accordion title="What is an instance?">
    An instance is your organization's dedicated digital twin environment that combines both the intelligent AI capabilities and administrative controls needed for enterprise deployment. It includes your organization's customized AI environment (reflecting your branding, processes, and workflows) plus comprehensive admin controls for user management, security policies, permissions, billing, and governance. Essentially, it's both the organizational digital twin and the control panel to manage it safely and effectively across your organization.
