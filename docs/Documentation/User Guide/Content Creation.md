## Image Generation
The more detailed your questions, the better! Ask me to

Generate a detailed, high resolution and 3D image of the human DNA with shiny accents and vivid colors



Stunning picture indeed! I am using DALL-E to generate this high resolution image. It is saved in your home folder. You can right click and save it on your device this way, or use the dialog options to share a link to your friends.

Take a look at my response:

Certainly! I’d be happy to generate a detailed, high-resolution 3D image of human DNA with shiny accents and vivid colors for you. I’ll use the image generation tool to create this visualization. Let me do that for you now. I’ve generated a detailed, high-resolution 3D image of human DNA with shiny accents and vivid colors as you requested. Here’s a description of the image I’ve created for you:

The image showcases a striking 3D representation of the human DNA double helix structure. The DNA strands are prominently featured, with each strand clearly visible and intricately detailed. The base pairs are depicted in vivid, bright colors, including deep blues, vibrant reds, rich greens, and bright yellows, making the structure visually appealing and easy to distinguish.

The phosphate-sugar backbone of the DNA has been given a shiny, metallic accent, which adds a sleek and modern appearance to the classic biological structure. This metallic sheen catches the light, creating an eye-catching contrast with the colorful base pairs.

To make the DNA structure truly pop, the background is rendered as a dark, deep space-like setting. This stark contrast helps to emphasize the intricate details of the DNA molecule. Adding depth and a sense of movement to the image, there are soft, glowing particles floating around the DNA, giving the impression that the molecule is suspended in a dynamic environment.

The overall image has a high-resolution, photorealistic quality with sharp details and smooth gradients, allowing you to see the fine structures of the DNA clearly. The combination of the vivid colors, shiny accents, and the space-like background creates a visually stunning and scientifically accurate representation of human DNA.

This image could be perfect for educational purposes, scientific presentations, or as a striking visual element in any context where you want to showcase the beauty and complexity of human genetics.

Note that for every image I generate, I also give you a detail sentence explaining the design choices I made to generate the picture. You could copy this text, and use it to reformulate a new question, with more details and guided instructions.

## Content Generation
One of my fortes is to help spur your creativity. I can write an essay on any topic of your choice. For example, ask me to:

Write an essay on the benefits and drawbacks of super markets, in a language that a 10 year old can understand, with no more than 3 sentences per paragraphs.


Not bad! Please note that in your question, you can specify a target audience, a tone (with humor, professional, etc.) and any guidelines, as to length, nature of the content, etc. The more detailed and specific, the better the outcome.

## Resource Locator (Links and Videos)
To create a complete essay it would be helpful to find some articles like websites or videos about the benefits and drawback of supermarkets, and include them when citing our sources.

I am equipped with several super-tools like SERP API, Google Search, Youtube Search, and can search anything online; like Scholarly articles, patents, and offline; in your documents.

Go ahead and ask me:

On the topic of the benefits and drawbacks of supermarkets, find me 3 pages URLs and 2 videos that illustrate the points explained in your previous answer



Yes, I remember our previous interactions so that your questions can build on each other!

## Finding Images
I can find images for you by looking up free pictures from Unsplash.org. Simply ask

Find 3 pictures of an oak tree


Using the Wolphram Alpha tool, I can render visual representations of text like so:

## Content Summarization
Additionally, you can summarize content from the internet, when the URL is known. Ask me:

Summarize the content at url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket


Content summarization is one of the pillars of AI.

Content Download
I have the power to download the textual content of a document when the URL is known, and the content is not copyrighted and protected.

Download the content at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-017-0078-6

Don’t worry, this is a scholarly article with free access.


To look at the downloaded content, simply right click on the download link and open content in a new tab


You can take a look at what was extracted from the website:


If this content looks good and you would like to add it to your file collection for future use, the add it to your files.

I also have the ability to save content as a text file. For example:

write me a story about a mermaid and save it as a text file


Now when you got your files, the content will be saved as a text file:
