## Speech to Text

Select the microphone to start recording your voice.

Note: The first time, you will need to grant your browser access to your microphone. Select Allow on every visit to save your choice for next time.

## Convo Mode

Convo mode lets you talk directly with your digital twin using your voice, just like having a real conversation. Instead of typing everything, you can simply speak and receive spoken responses in return.

When you turn on this feature, you can:

Ask questions out loud and get immediate spoken answers
Give commands using just your voice
Continue conversations naturally without typing
Multitask while getting information or assistance
This is especially helpful when:

Your hands are busy with other tasks
You’re on the go and can’t easily type
You prefer speaking over typing
You need quick information without stopping what you’re doing
Using this feature is simple – just click the conversation icon in your app. You’ll see a microphone button appear that you can tap to start speaking. The system will listen to your question or request and respond with both text and a spoken reply.


In Convo mode, the yellow icon (1) glows when detecting input from your Audio microphone device. When I speak, the blue ison will glow (2). You can adjust the output level with the volume slider (3) velow


The transcripts of the conversation will be automatically saved in the main dialogue window for your easy reference. You can access these transcripts at any time to review previous interactions, search for specific information, or share the conversation history with others. This feature ensures that no valuable information is lost and provides a complete record of your communication.
