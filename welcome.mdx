Praxis AI empowers organizations to deploy Digital Experts: intelligent, customizable AI consultants with distinct personalities, voices, and specialized knowledge.

Backed by secure, isolated IPVaults and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), each Digital Expert works autonomously while protecting sensitive information. With multi-modal interaction, tool integrations, and model flexibility, your team can scale effortlessly—turning AI from a tool into a trusted teammate.

## Scalable Hierarchy

Like a well-conducted symphony, every part of your AI organization plays in harmony. The organizational account is the conductor, guiding multiple Digital Experts as sections of the orchestra, each with their own assistants as individual instruments. Together, they create a seamless performance—precise, adaptable, and perfectly in tune with your goals.
